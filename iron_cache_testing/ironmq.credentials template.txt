1. Create a file like this in a directory named "unversioned" besides the other directories like "packages" or ".nuget".
2. Name the file "ironmq.credentials.txt".
3. Insert your credentials like above in the top 2 lines of this file.
4. Link to the file here in this project.
5. Set "copy to output dir" to "if newer".

The file will be used by the test project to pull the credentials from.
It´s a safe place to put your credentials because the directory "unversioned" is, well, not versioned. It will
not end up in the repository (see .gitignore).
